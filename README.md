## Features
- Pin screenshots to be on top of every window.
- Resize, move and remove pinned images using simple mouse controls.

## Requirements
- You'll need at least Java 17 installed.

## Usage
### Creating a Pinned Image
1. While the main window is open, simply press "From Screen" to start selecting a region from the screen to pin.
2. Drag click anywhere on the screen to select a region to pin.
3. That's it! A pinned image is created in the same location as the region.
4. You can also pin images from your clipboard, just press "From Clipboard" instead.

### Pinned Image Controls

- **Scale** a pinned image to be bigger or smaller by using the scroll wheel (or touchpad equivalents).
- **Remove** a pinned image by right clicking on an image.

Hovering over a pinned images shows additional controls:

### System Tray
If your operating system supports it, when you close the main window, it'll sit in your system tray. From here you can perform the same actions you can from the main window. You can also force quit the program through this.
